# Hi, I'm Elliot 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on **ÖMC's Instructor Application** (private repo), a tool designed to manage instructors and scheduling. I'm also developing a **WordPress site** with a custom-built theme for a friend's project.
🤝Both of these projects are made in collaboration with [Johannes Stenfeldt](https://github.com/Jeorge01).

🌱 I'm actively expanding my knowledge in **React** and **WordPress theme development**.
